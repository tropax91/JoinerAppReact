# JoinerAppReact
Bachelor's project in Software Development

## Description
This is my Bachelor project with 2 of my classmates where we try to develop a web application for a joinery workshop, that allows customers to design and order custom wood boards.
Technologies used are as follows: .Net Core for the backend and React for the frontend. We used a library called Maker.JS to build a shape designer that defines paths(line, arc, circle).
